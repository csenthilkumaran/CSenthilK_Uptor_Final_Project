""" Project Detailing """
        1. Main Project with complete study of input features data and multiple target with
        different supervised and Unsupervised algorithms
                file name << Senthil_Uptor_Final_MainProject_FullComplete.py >>
        2. Linear Regression Model for Sample Deployment using pickle and flask libraries
                file name << Senthil_Uptor_Final_Project_LinearRegression.py >>
                pkl file <<  Senthil_Final_linear_model_pickling.pkl >>
                python deployment file << Senthil_Uptor_Final_Project_LRModel_Deploy.py >>
        3. Senthil_Uptor_Final_Project.csv dataset

Following the 5 step process of Machine Learning

Define the Problem: Identify the task and collect relevant data.
       Approach towards  Manufacturing Segment Data set with Time series data for Machine Learning
       using Supervised and Unsupervised Algorithms
       Target to predict the Production related parameters like units/ hours, defective rate, efficiency

       Senthil_Uptor_Final_Project.csv file is used with lots of various input features to predict the required target

Prepare the Data: Clean, preprocess and transform the data.

        The time series data is preprocessed for proper datatypes and removing non number values etc
        Prepared the data for different features data set and target dataset

Choose a Model: Select an appropriate ML algorithm.

      "K-Means algorithm - Unsupervised learning model for grouping the similar data points of all Target parameters\n"
      "Target > ProductionSpeed->Linear Regression"
                Linear regression is used for predicting continuous production speed on more input features
      "Target > PredictiveScore PM_Score ->XgB "
                XGBRegressor in Python is the regression-specific implementation of XGBoost and is used for
                regression problems where the intent fpr Predictive maintenance scoring

      "Target > Efficiency-> Decision Tree \n"

      "Target > QCDefectRate-> PCA and Linear Regression\n")


Train the Model: Fit the model to the training data.
        Linear Regression
        Decision Tree and confusion matrix
        XgB Regressor
        K-Means unsupervised algorithm

Evaluate and Deploy: Test performance on unseen data and deploy.
        Sample deployment with Linear regression model is attached with the separate file for LRModel_Deploy
        The *.pkl file created for deploying the simple linear regression model to predict the Production speed
